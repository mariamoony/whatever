        <div class="item item_1">Newton Artemis Fido "Newt" Scamander,[2] O.M. (Second Class), (b. 24 February,[1] 1897)[2] was an English wizard, famed Magizoologist and the author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Early in life, Scamander developed an interest in magical creatures, influenced by his mother's breeding of Hippogriffs. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was sorted into Hufflepuff House. While at Hogwarts he was sentenced to expulsion, though Albus Dumbledore, who had been his Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, recognised his innocence, and objected strongly.</div>
