                Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, O.M. (First Class), Grand Sorc., D. Wiz., X.J.
                (sorc.), S. of Mag.Q.[25] (c. Summer[1] 1881[3] – 30 June, 1997)[3] was an English half-blood wizard. He
                was the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, later the Transfiguration Professor, and later the
                Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also served as Supreme Mugwump of the
                International Confederation of Wizards (?–1995) and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot (?–1995; 1996–1997).
                A Muggle-supporting wizard, though the complete opposite in his earlier years, he was considered to have
                been the greatest wizard of modern times, perhaps of all time.

                He was the son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth and Ariana. His
                father died in Azkaban when Albus was young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed.
                His early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death many years later, but, in turn, made
                him a better person.
